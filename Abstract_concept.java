// abstract class is used to implement the concept of OOPS which is Data Abstraction, hidding the details and only showing the neccessary functionality to the user
// for abstract class we cannot create object 
// The abstract method is declared in the abstract class and is defined outside the abstract class that is inside the derived class
// Example a abstract class car has drive method declared and is defined in the derived class of maruti suzuki
// Abstract class can contain abstract and non abstract method but the abstract method will be only present inside the abstract class
// abstract can have public, private or protected access specifier


/* 
Uses of static-

1. Static belongs to the class, and the static variable or method are called using class name whereas non-static which belongs to the method and are called using object
2. For static only ones the memory is created and provided to it, unlike for non-static where for every object a new memory is given. Therefore to static save the memory usage
3. Basically you create static for which you want something common throughout the program like for Students data the School will be common
