Collection framework- Java collection framework provides the feature for storing and manipulation of groups or large amount of data
Example - List,Set, Queue, Maps, HastSet etc

Without collection framework you will require array which has fixed size and does not support dynamic resizing and advanced operation like sorting, searching or iteration

Collection framework provides dynamic resizing 

In Array you can store primitive datatype  

In ArrayList everything is stored in the form of object and its stored in the heap memory

In Array List, the time complexity of searching operation is Big O(1), as arr[7], i.e in one operation we found the element which is the efficient way

However for the insert operation the time complexity will become Big O(n), as we need to shift every element which is time taking and not the efiecient way hence here comes the use of Linked List

As in Linked List we insert the element just by changing/pointing the links of the address, there is no shifting of the elements therefore it is more efficient 
 
In Conclusion:-

                      ArrayList         V/S           Linked List

Insert Op-             O(N)              >               O(1)

Search Op-             O(1)              <               O(N)
